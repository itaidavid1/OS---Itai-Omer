ANSWERS:
Assignment 1:
The code is an example of system call for a program name whatIDo
Briefly:
As mentioned in the ex file, we can ignore all the file loading commands, and focus on the program.
The program is creating a directory called "welcome_dir_1" in the current working directory and then creating another
directory inside it called "welcome_dir_2". We will notice that the directories open with full permissions indicated by
the value of 0777. It allocates memory for the program data segment and then creates a file called "welcome_file.txt"
inside "welcome_dir_2", writes "welcome to OS-2023" to it, and closes the file. We can notice that the program also
reads from the localtime file, and changing the offset of the file and reading it again but not writing it.
At the end, The code then deletes "welcome_file.txt", "welcome_dir_2", followed by deleting "welcome_dir_1".
Finally, the program exits with status 0.

In detailed:
we will describe each line to explain the program:
1. mkdir("./welcome_dir_1", 0777) = 0 : creates a new directory called "welcome_dir_1" in the current directory with
full permissions by the value of 0777.
The mkdir function returns 0 on success.

2. mkdir("./welcome_dir_1/welcome_dir_2", 0777) = 0 : same as section 1, but here creates
a new subdirectory called "welcome_dir_2" inside the "welcome_dir_1"

3. brk(NULL) = 0x562af8dbe000 : usually brk command sets the end of the data segment to the given address
here we using this with null, so the function returns the current program break address,
which is 9.4742564e+13 - meaning checking where is the heap memory ends

4. brk(0x562af8ddf000) = 0x562af8ddf000: to increase the program's data segment by a certain amount, up to the given
address - allocating space by changing the end of the data segment address to the new given one.

5. openat(AT_FDCWD, "./welcome_dir_1/welcome_dir_2/welcome_file.txt" :
according to the man function, the "openat" system call we used is:
int openat(int dirfd, const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode); has 4 argument,
and according to this the given line  opens a new file called "welcome_file.txt" inside the path
./welcome_dir_1/welcome_dir_2/. The given AT_FDCWD indicats to take  a relative path argument will be resolved relative
to the current working directory, and the flags after are specify that the file for writing and
creating it if it didnt exist already. The return value 3 is a possitive number which indicates
for success job and gives a uniquely identifies for the file.

6. openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/localtime", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 4:
opens the system's local time zone file, located at "/etc/localtime", only for reading. the 4 return value for success.

7. fstat(4, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=2388, ...}) = 0:
gets the file descriptor and buffer. get  the information about the file descriptor 4, which is currently pointing to
the local time zone file from section 6.

8. fstat(4, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=2388, ...}) = 0: the same as above

9. read(4, "TZif3\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\t\0\0\0\t\0\0\0\0"..., 4096) = 2388  :
ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);
read() attempts to read up to count bytes from file descriptor fd into the buffer starting at buf.
in this case we are trying to read file 4 which is the time zone file. The return value is the number
of bytes the system read.

10. lseek(4, -1506, SEEK_CUR) = 882 :
moves the current offset of the file descriptor 4 back by 1506 bytes
the return value of 882 indicates that the new offset is byte 882.
We can see that the last offset was 2388 -1506 will bring us to 882

11. read(4, "TZif3\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\t\0\0\0\t\0\0\0\0"..., 4096) = 1506
now from the 882 offset we reat 1506 bytes until the end

12 . close(4)= 0  : closing the file for reading

13. fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=0, ...}) = 0 :
   gets the file descriptor and buffer. get  the information about the file descriptor 3, which is currently pointing to
    the welcome file from section 5.

14. write(3, "welcome to OS-2023", 18) = 18: write the string "welcome to OS-2023" to the file
The return value is the number of bytes writen in the file- and 18 is the size of the
"welcome to OS-2023" string.

15. close(3) = 0: closing the file above

16. unlink("./welcome_dir_1/welcome_dir_2/welcome_file.txt") = 0 : deleting file - it deleted successfully.

17. unlink("./welcome_dir_1/welcome_dir_2") = -1 EISDIR (Is a directory: tryed to delete file where it is directory
and failed

18 . rmdir("./welcome_dir_1/welcome_dir_2")  = 0 : deleting the dir successfully

19. unlink("./welcome_dir_1") = -1 EISDIR (Is a directory) +  rmdir("./welcome_dir_1") = 0:
same sequence as above

20. exit_group(0) = ? : closing all treads of the program, returning nothing therefor ?

21. +++ exited with 0 +++ : output of the screen after finishing strace
